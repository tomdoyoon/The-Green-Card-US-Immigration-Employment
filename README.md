# The Green Card - US Immigration Employment

# Abstract

This report analyzes trends and relationships between features of prospective employers, employees, and jobs to determine how a hopeful immigrant can have the most successful chance in obtaining a Green Card through an employer. Every year, millions of immigrants become lawful permanent residents of the United States, also known as Green Card holders. In the FY 2020, over 60% of all successful Green Card applicants were either an immediate relative of U.S. citizens or related to a U.S. Citizen or Green Card holder. The most common method, outside of the family-based immigration method, is through the employment-based immigration method. Approximately 21% of new Green Card holders were sponsored by an employer or self-petitioned through investing to create U.S. jobs.

The study compiles, cleans, and manipulates employment PERM (Green Card) data from the U.S. Department of Labor over FY 2015-FY 2021. The report details the natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, cyclical features encoding, normalization techniques, anomaly and outlier detection, statistical analysis and machine learning models used to learn more about permanent immigration through employment.

An applicant should seek out jobs that have a minimum education level of a bachelor’s degree, as jobs that require a bachelor’s degree are 22% more successful than jobs that require a High School diploma or an associate degree. Software developer – applications, software developer – systems software, and computer systems analyst have an 8% advantage over other jobs. Applicants to a large company, with 10,000 or more employees, are 9% more likely to obtain a Green Card than an applicant to a small company, less than 1,000 employees. Unfortunately, jobs that require formal training that are not for a hospital or university have a 62.29% success rate, compared to 94% for jobs at a hospital or university. 

The objective of the report is to provide an independent study into how an immigrant can have the most successful chance at becoming permanently employed in the United States. This is done through analyzing and interpreting the trends found within the total PERM data sets. It is important to note, however, the changing nature of immigration and employment; what was the trend over the last seven years, may not repeat itself.

# Introduction

Please use the Table of Contents, found below, to navigate the project!

In this project I explore PERM (Green Card) data compiled from the U.S. Department of Labor over 2014-2021. The data can be retrieved, partitioned by year, from the Performance Data section of the Foreign Labor Certification section, under Employment and Training Administration.

For ease of use, I cleaned and compiled each of the following year's PERM data:
- FY2021, FY2020, FY2019, FY2018, FY2017, FY2016, and FY2015

While data was available from FY2008, granular data on the applicant, employer, and application was only available from FY2015 to present. 

I analyze the trends found within successful applicants; however, it is important to note that all applicants have already faced "success". This is due to the nature of the data - all applicants have already impressed an employer, passed the interviews, and received a job offer all as a foreign national. To provide further insight into the candidates that are chosen for Green Card sponsorship, I analyze not only features of candidates that eventually received a "certified" case status, but also every candidate an employer applied for.

The project is concluded with a classification deep learning model, Up sampled Random Forest model, Down sampled Random Forest model, SMOTE Random Forest model, and a regular Random Forest model that all have an objective to estimate if a particular applicant will be successful and receive a certified status.

# Observations and Findings:

All % differences mentioned are statistically significant.

Please read the full report for further insights about the observations and findings.

- Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google have all never been outside of the top 15, ranked by total successful applications.
- The top 15 employers by total applications are 5% more successful compared to companies not within the top 15.
- Microsoft pays the most if you work out of NY and CA. NJ and FL also have a decent median wage, however, the experience required is higher compared to NY and CA.
- Medium (1000-10000 employees) and Large (10000+ employees) companies have a statistically significant growth in success rate each year, while Small (<1000 employees) companies do not have a statistically significant growth in success rate. Medium and Large companies have a higher success rate (6% and 9%, respectively) compared to Small companies.
- Young (<15 years) companies have a lower success rate than medium (15-30 years) and old (30+ years) companies. More established companies are 4% more successful than younger companies. 
- Companies within the top 15 NAICS codes by applications, are 5% more successful than companies out of the top 15. However, both companies in the top 15 and not in the top 15 are growing in terms of success rates each year.
- Applicants earning above the 33rd percentile of wages are 9% more successful than those under the 33rd percentile. However, an applicant in the 66th percentile and above, does not see a large benefit in comparison with an applicant in the 33rd to 66th percentile. Applicants in the 66th percentile are more likely to work in CA, NY, and TX. Medium (33-66 percentile) and High (66+ percentile) earners are getting more successful by .64% and .67%, while Low earners do not have a statistically significant growth in success rate.
- Applicants that work as one of the top 5 PW SOC Codes (the top 5 SOC codes vary slightly every year, but these three are never not in the top 5: software developers - applications, computer systems analyst, and software developers - systems software) are 8% more successful than applicant who do not work as one of the top 5 SOC codes. Applicants that work as on the of the top 5 PW SOC Codes are likely to live in CA, NJ, TX, and WA.
- Applicants working in one of the top 5 states are 3% more successful than applicants who do not. CA, TX, NJ, and NY are never not in the top 5.
- Applicant working in one of the top 10 cities are 6% more successful than applicants who do not. New York City, San Jose, Mountain View, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Seattle are never not in the top 10.
- Jobs with the minimum required education of High School and associate's degree are 22% less likely to be successful than those that require a bachelor's degree and 23% less successful than those that require a master's or doctorate degree.
- Applicants for Level 2-Level 4 jobs are growing in success rates by a range of .5-.9% a year. Level 2 - Level 4 have a 7% success advantage over Level 1 jobs.
- Jobs that are deemed professional, and not a professor, have a success growth rate of .77% a year and applicants have a 18% advantage by applying for a professional job.
- Jobs that have an employee referral program are growing in success by .85%, while jobs that don't are still also growing at .5%. However, jobs with a referral program have a 3% advantage over jobs that don't.
- Jobs that are advertised in a professional organization are growing by 1.3% in success and are 4% more successful than jobs that were not. Jobs advertised in a private employment firm have a 4% advantage, however they are not growing in success, significantly. Jobs that are not advertised by a private firm are growing in success by .6%.
- H-1B is the most common admission class for applicants. Those admitted with an H-1B have an 8% advantage over other class of admissions. However, F-1 and L-1 classes have a 13% advantage over the other class of admission, net H-1B.
- Jobs that do not require training are 8% more likely to be successful. However, jobs for hospitals, clinics, and universities (doctors and professors) have a 94% success rate while all the other jobs that require training and are not in hospitals, clinics, and universities have a 62.29% success rate. A similar observation is had with jobs that require experience. Jobs that do not require experience are 3% more likely to be accepted. Companies that work in computer systems and software have a success rate of around 94% while the jobs for companies that require experiences but are not in computer systems and software have a 84-86% success rate.

# Model Evaluations:

The outcome of the Green Card application is heavily imbalanced, 93.317% of all applications were successful.


The top performing classification model would be the random forest model with an over sample of the minority, with a macro average F1 score of .83. Prediction of success had a F1 of .98 and prediction of reject had a F1 of .67.

It is important to note, that a random forest model without any resampling had a macro average F1 score of .82. Prediction of success had a F1 of .98 and a prediction of reject had a F1 of .66. From the initial observations, it does not appear that applying advanced resampling techniques provides a significant improvement.
